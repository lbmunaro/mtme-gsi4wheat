## MTME-based genomic selection index optimization for soft red winter wheat

This repository contains code, data, and documentation for developing and evaluating a multi-trait, multi-environment (MTME) genomic selection index (GSI) for soft red winter wheat improvement. The project integrates genomic prediction models with empirically derived economic weights to optimize selection decisions across traits and environments, using data from the University of Illinois wheat breeding program.
